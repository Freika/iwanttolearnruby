Learn to build <a href="https://github.com/rubyonrailstutor/restaurantly">Restaurantly</a>, a simple restaurant review app that is test driven including capybara integration tests, uses haml, git branching, rails 4, ruby 2, rspec, devise, omniauth, twitter login, zurb-foundation and thoughtbot's factory-girl.  The idea is that you watch the videos and then build your own clone of the app, learning as you go.  Working source code is cloneable at <a href="https://github.com/rubyonrailstutor/restaurantly">Restuarantly</a>.
