The Pragmatic Programmer provides a host of technical resources for a variety of languages.  Specifically, I found that Agile Web Deveopment with Rails (4th) edition was particularly useful.
I just finished Pragmatic Thinking and Learning which gave helpful advice about how to get the most out of our mental capacities when we code.  I would highly recommend all of their resources.
