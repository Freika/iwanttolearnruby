Any resources you know that people can use to learn ruby (or rails, or anything else you think relevant).

Resources I'm aware of that I haven't had a chance to add yet include:

* ...

Improvements to the code or the site are also appreciated. Some ideas:

* Add rake task to generate new posts

Tragically, I haven't had time (or money) to try all of these resources - I'm relying on impressions and descriptions for some of them.  If you feel the level is inaccurate, or the description is misleading, or you just don't like it - feel free to change it and send me a pull request!  I'd greatly appreciate it.

Many of the descriptions are taken directly from the resource's site, I mean no copyright infringement by this.
